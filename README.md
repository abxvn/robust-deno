Robust Deno
=====

I've been fascinated over these years of Deno releases and feature sets, so I decided to create a Robust Framework version built with Deno, along with current [Robust Node](https://github.com/tekuasia/robust).

FYI, since we wanna ultilize the best out of both Node and Deno, and they are quite different, these 2 replications of Robust Framework are also different down to their core. But the main thing is, Robust's methodology and visions are shared between them, and hopefully some of the code (since they'll be both written in Typescript).

Robust Framework Deno version is aimed to be released 3 to 4 months after the first release of its Node counterpart.

Stay tune.
